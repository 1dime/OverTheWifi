The RedDog code of conduct is just basic:
  Anyone caught being an asshole to another is removed from development. Context is important, so if the user is obviously making a joke, no removal will be made, but they will be noted.
  Just code for the love of it, be nice to your fellow programmers, have fun, and you'll be safe.
 
  If someone is being an asshole to you, notify me on my Reddit account at https://reddit.com/u/froggie-style-meme or on my Twitter account @RedDogCode
